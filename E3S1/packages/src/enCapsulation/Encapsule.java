public class Encapsule {
	
//	Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit,
//	for example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.
	
	
//	We can create a fully encapsulated class in Java by making all the data members of the class private.
//	Now we can use setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it.
//	The 'Java Bean' class is the example of a fully encapsulated class.
	
	
//	Advantage of Encapsulation in Java
	
//	By providing only a setter or getter method, you can make the class read-only or write-only.
//	In other words, you can skip the getter or setter methods
	
	
//	It provides you the control over the data. 
//	
//	It is a way to achieve data hiding in Java because other class will not be able to access the data through the private data members
//	
//	The encapsulate class is easy to test. So, it is better for unit testing.
//	
//	The standard IDE's are providing the facility to generate the getters and setters.
//	So, it is easy and fast to create an encapsulated class in Java.
