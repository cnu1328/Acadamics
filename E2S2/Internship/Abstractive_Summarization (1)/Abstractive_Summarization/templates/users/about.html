      <hr width="20%"></center>
      <p class="card-text float-start" style="width: 80%;text-align: justify;">Initially, we have started this LTRC4Indic program on <i>1st September 2019</i> under the supervision of <a href='https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/m.shrivastava/' target="_blank">Dr. Manish Shrivasta</a>. As a pilot study, this program initiates for the annotation of Telugu abstractive summarization corpus. After a lot of brainstorming, <i>Dr. Manish Shrivstava</i> suggested us to <b><q>begin this program with a 10 weeks virtual internship followed by in campus summer and long-term internships</q></b>. In the first year, we got around 350 registrations from the two institutes. Majority of the registrations came from popular institutes of Andhrapradesh and Telangana states.</p>

      <p class="card-text float-end" style="width: 80%;text-align: justify;">Since 2019, We have been hosting students from reputed institutes at IIIT-Hyderabad for their internships. Upon completion of summer and remote internships, students have learned NLP concepts and implemented large-scale projects on Indian Languages. Among them, some students have been offered a long-term internship to continue their research in the LTRC lab. The main aim of this internship program is to introduce NLP and Deep Learning concepts to enthusiastic students and allow the students to contribute to the projectsâ€™ entire pipeline: from data preparation to model deployment.</p>

      <hr width="40%"></center>
      <p class="card-text">This internship program is a 8-10 weeks program where the selected students will learn the NLP and Deep Learning concepts. In this program, the students who are about to complete their graduation from the reputed institutes will be selected. Upon selection process, the intern will be assigned to a mentor for one of the crowdsourced data tasks</p>
      <p class="card-text">In NLP tutorial & sessions, each week, we'll take a lecture on the predefined lecture contents and release the assignment on the same topic along with the Quiz. Also, we monitor the performance of the students' and resolve their queries in the NLP course.</p>
      <p class="card-text">Last but not least, In crowdsourced data tasks, each registered student will be assigned to one of the tasks. Initially, interns will be trained with the data tasks using the pilot study policy (where each intern will be assigned with set of samples). After training session, each user will be assigned with the set of samples in an iterative manner to work on the data annotation tasks. Each interns performance will be evaluated by assigned evaluator and provide the feedback to improve thier performance in upcoming tasks.</p>

Projects will be given in the area of Machine translation, Summarization and Question answering (<a href='https://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/#nlpmt' target="_blank">ltrc-nlpmt</a>). In this internship selection process, we'll check the performance of the student in remote internship program and their commitment towards contributing to the data annotation tasks.</p>

      <p class="card-text">Apart from the summer internship project, each annotator will be assigned to a data annotation task. Here, the main motto is to train the interns for building models on various problem statments and understand the impact of data in those models.</p>

      <p class="card-text">In this Long-term Internship program, interns are assigned with a project for a group of 2-4 members. In this program each intern has to do the data evaluation task along with the project work.</p>

      <p class="card-text">In data evaluation task, each intern will be trained with sample data evaluation (where sample data includes 5-10 samples for evaluation). The quality of these evaluations will be verified by the task coordinator and provide coordinator will provide feedback to intern for improvement in performance. Upon completion of the training phase, each evaluator will get 5-10 annotated submissions in an iterative way with fixed deadlines. Here, evaluator needs to evaluate each submission and provide the feedback/comments to the annotator along with the evaluations scores.</p>

      <p class="card-text">In the project work, intern has to develop a baseline model in the first 1-2 months with significant results. Later, the intern has to improve the model or build their own model specific to the given problem statement.</p>
